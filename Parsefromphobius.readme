Parse from phobius will allow to parse the sequences obtained by the analysis performed with phobius. 
As it is now, the script will allow you to parse all the receptors that contain from 4 to 9 transmembrane domains. This value can be changed 
by modifying the range in line 16.

The input needed for this script is a CSV file produced by phobius. 
The output will be a list will only the ID of the sequences that have between 4 to 9 transmembrane domains.
